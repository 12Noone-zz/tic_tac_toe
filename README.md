# tic_tac_toe/
<!-- 
Tic tac toe is a game where two players alternate. There are X's and O's. Three X's or O's in a row
means the player has won.

We need a grid layout that will allow the user to click to add an X or an O. 

HTML 
tables seem to be the best option here, bummer we haven't really gone over them. 


CSS
border-left/right/bottom left out when appropriate to make it look like the tictactoe board
class for the x and o that are applied when the proper grid is clicked.


JAVASCRIPT
so what will happen here? when we click on a spot we want an X or an O to show up.
The X and O ought to be different colors, I suppose.
The bitchy kitty here, is how to teach javascript to look for the right 
combination of X's and O's? three in a row or diagonal?

so we can store the tictac toe board in an array. an array of arrays. I hate arrays of arrays. maybe I can space it out so it resembles the board?

we can write a function that will iterate through the array and, upon clicking, test if there's anything in the array in the corresponding spot. if yes, do nothing, if no, addClass x or o.
